# üîí SafetyFirst Firewall Blocker by @jdabsofficial

This is a simple Windows batch script that blocks every `.exe`, `.com`, `.scr`, and `.bat` file in a folder (and its subfolders) using the Windows Firewall.

It‚Äôs useful if you want to stop unknown apps from accessing the internet, or if you‚Äôre testing untrusted files.

## üì¶ How It Works

- It scans the folder where the script is placed.
- Every executable file it finds will be **blocked from both sending and receiving internet data**.
- A **firewall backup** is automatically created before any changes.
